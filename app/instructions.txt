RESTful API
-----------

GET /api/airports - retrieve all airports, sort by airport code----->done
GET /api/airports?sortBy=column where column is: code, city, kind----->done
GET /api/airports/YUL - retrieve a single airport data by primary key (code)----------->done

POST /api/airports - create a record, code and city must not be in use, otherwise 209
PUT /api/airports/YUL - code is not changable, new city must not be in use, otherwise 209
DELETE /api/airports/YUL - delete, fails with 404 if airport does not exist (not strictly RESTful-compliant behaviour)

Post and Put must validate:
- code all uppercase 3-6 characters
- city 1-40 characters, must not exist yet
- latitude -90 to 90, longitude -180 to 180
